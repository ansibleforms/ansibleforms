* playbook output is written in batches, and too much of it no longer kills the playbook ([#902](https://github.com/ansibleforms/ansibleforms/issues/902)) ([679cc19](https://github.com/ansibleforms/ansibleforms/commit/679cc19265b529b4de4bb678d3f8c445f76b07dd))

## [6.3.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

-   Declarative config seed (`CONFIG_SEED_PATH`) — rebuild an instance from a yaml file. See `docs/seed.md`
-   An empty database creates its own schema at startup
-   Audit trail (`/admin/audit`) — append-only, and secrets are never stored
-   Status page (`/admin/status`)
-   Job and job output retention (`JOB_RETENTION_DAYS`), off by default
-   Visual editors for Categories, Roles and Constants. Comments and anchors survive a save
-   The config source is switchable from the UI (`config_source`) — file or database
-   A HashiCorp Vault page, with a read-only connection test
-   Environment variables are editable from the settings page, saved to `persistent/.env`
-   Config API — read, write, import, export and convert. See `GET /api/v2/docs`
-   The designer was rebuilt — a file tree, and buttons instead of raw YAML
-   The settings pages were rebuilt — tabbed, with per-field help
-   Server-wide default language and theme, plus a Color theme
-   A visual cron editor with presets and a next-runs preview
-   Schedules can be created from the admin UI
-   `GIT_PUSH_COMMAND` env var added, to customize the command used when pushing git repositories
-   Group filter for LDAP (admin panel > LDAP > Group Filter). A regular expression matched against the group name, the same one Entra ID and OIDC already have — only matching groups are kept, mapped to roles and sent to playbooks. Empty keeps every group, which is what every existing installation does today. A pattern that does not compile is logged and ignored rather than stripping everyone's roles
-   `EXTRAVARS_USER_FIELDS` env var and the `userExtravars` form property, to choose which keys of the launching user are sent to the playbook as `ansibleforms_user`. Empty keeps the whole object, as before; a comma separated list keeps only those keys and `none` sends nothing. The form property overrides the environment variable. The frontend `__user__` object and every permission check are unaffected. See `docs/faq.md`
-   The config seed is re-applied when the file changes (`CONFIG_SEED_RELOAD_SECONDS`, 60s by default), so a seed edited in git reaches a running instance without restarting it. `POST /api/v2/config-seed/apply` and `SIGHUP` force an apply immediately. A failed reload is never fatal: the configuration already in force is kept and the Status page reports it. See `docs/seed.md`
-   `EXPRESSION_SANITIZER` env var, to choose how strictly server expressions (without `runLocal`) are checked: `off` refuses every server expression, `paranoid` allows only direct `fn.`/`fnc.` calls, `strict` (default) also allows methods on their result, and `legacy` restores the 6.2.1 rules. `legacy` lets any authenticated user run code on the server, so it can only be set in the real environment (not from the settings page), logs a warning at startup and for every expression `strict` would refuse, and shows as a warning on the Status page
-   Categories can be moved around the tree — move up, move down, indent and outdent, in the settings Categories page and in the designer, taking the whole subtree along
-   Constants can hold a list or a nested object — the value box in the designer and on the settings page is read as YAML, so a block list, a list of objects and a nested map are stored as such instead of as their source text

### Changed

-   Permission failures answer `403` instead of `401`
-   `PUT /api/v2/settings/` is now a partial update
-   The settings menu has five sections: System, Forms, Access, Connections, Jobs
-   Menu entries your role cannot open are hidden
-   The designer works when the config lives in the database
-   Backup and restore follow the active config source
-   LDAP loses its Advanced toggle — the four group fields always apply

### Removed

-   LDAP `is_advanced` toggle. On upgrade the fields are blanked where it was off, old values logged first

### Fixed

-   A designer save deleted form files the loader had skipped
-   A repository named `forms` treated its whole root as a forms folder, so a save deleted unrelated yaml files
-   Approving a job twice at once launched it twice
-   A multistep step whose status could not be read counted as passed
-   A failed backup listed as a valid restore point
-   Restoring a backup with no usable dump reported success
-   `NIGHTLY_BACKUP_RETENTION=0` deleted every nightly backup
-   The designer could silently overwrite a form — ids were reused
-   Designer saves wrote to the local `config.yaml` while the app read a repository
-   The designer overwrote a ytt-templated config with its rendered output
-   Designer edits were discarded when navigating away or reloading
-   The "Show Extravars" role option never took effect — two spellings
-   A login with no `Authorization: Basic` header hung for ever, leaking a socket
-   A `401` surviving a token refresh looped refresh and retry
-   `LOG_SYSLOG_PROTOCOL` never had any effect — misspelt read, so syslog always used UDP
-   MongoDB datasource queries always failed
-   Query fields inside a wizard step or list row failed for everyone except an admin
-   Query placeholders with dot notation, an index path or `placeholderColumn` stopped working
-   Query values were escaped with MySQL's rules on every datasource, corrupting backslashes and quotes
-   Renaming a repository moved its working tree before the change was written, orphaning it if refused
-   A cron schedule with an inverted range (`0 0 * * 5-1`) saved and never ran
-   An invalid `MASK_EXTRAVARS_REGEX` or `REGEX_FILTER_JOB_OUTPUT` broke job launching and made every job unviewable
-   Bulk delete on Known Hosts removed the wrong entries — rows were keyed by position
-   `OLD_BACKUP_DAYS=0` deleted every config restore point. It now keeps everything
-   `GET /api/v2/repository/<name>` kept answering with the `head` from before a pull for up to an hour. The repositories model is cached and `findByName` reads that cache, while the git operations wrote `status`, `output` and `head` with their own SQL and evicted nothing — so the single record disagreed with `GET /api/v2/repository` and with the database. Anything polling it to learn whether a commit had landed waited on a value that could not change
-   Wizard didn't load varsFiles
-   `target="_blank"` was stripped from links in `html` and `expression` fields, so they opened in the current tab and the form was lost (#480). `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is now forced on any link that opens a new tab
-   Startup failed with `Failed to create the path for the log files` when `LOG_PATH`'s parent folder did not exist — the folder is now created recursively
-   Prefill bug (relaunch and load from form)
-   Designer: while a form's YAML was invalid - halfway through typing any line - the form jumped to a "Parsing issues" group in the tree and the editor was rebuilt, losing the cursor and focus

### Security

-   A user without verbose permission could relaunch a verbose job and get its output
-   Server-side expressions could break out of the evaluator and run commands — the guard only checked how one started
-   A form you had no access to appeared on the home page when two files shared a name
-   A server expression reached banned names through string property keys (`fn.x['constructor']`) — arbitrary code execution for any signed-in user
-   A group name containing HTML ran as script in the users list
-   Opening another user's job answered 200 with an empty body instead of refusing, and approve/reject skipped its role check
-   A `git pull` that could not read its repository record published the stored password
-   `/api/v1/query` accepted arbitrary SQL, bypassing the v2 guard
-   Form load warnings rendered the form name as HTML on the home page
-   A failed login revealed whether the username existed
-   Changing a password needed no proof of the current one
-   The query endpoint ran any SQL from the request body, with only a login required
-   A field value reached a form expression as raw text, so a crafted link ran script
-   Refresh tokens were never verified, re-checked or retired
-   Anyone could sign in as any user, including admin, through the SSO endpoints
-   Reserved extravars from the request beat the form, so any playbook could run with any credential. A `__x__` key is now accepted only when the form declares a field of that name
-   Any authenticated user could abort any other user's job
-   An AWX workflow node name ran as script in the job output
-   Dropdown option values rendered unescaped while the search box was empty
-   The `ansible-vault` password was written to the log in full
-   `VAULT_TOKEN` was returned in clear text to any user with `showSettings`
-   The v2 log endpoints had no permission check
-   A duplicate role name in `config.yaml` granted its rights twice over
-   The backup's environment filter missed `export NAME=value`, shipping `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` beside the dump it decrypts
-   `POST /api/v2/schema` required no authentication and drops every table
-   `PUT /api/v2/settings` accepted `forms_yaml`, bypassing the lock, validation and restore point
-   `/admin/schedules` and `/admin/stored-jobs` were reachable with only `showSettings`
-   A form's `constants` came from the request instead of the configuration, so a caller could rescope a query

## [6.2.1] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

-   Upgraded git actions to v5
-   Enhanced table views
-   Database connection pooling for better performance

### Added

-   Translations (en, de, fr, es, it, nl)
-   new environment var DEFAULT_LANGUAGE (if no client cookie preference is passed)
-   New `wizard:` property on forms: render a sequence of reusable subforms as numbered steps with Back/Next navigation, per-step validation, optional `defaultModel` prefix to namespace each step's output, optional steps with `when:` visibility expressions, and a `summary` step that shows a read-only review of the merged extravars before submit. Cross-step references work via `$(__parent__.<stepname>.<field>)`.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

-   New `list` field type: a multi-row collection field where each row is edited via a subform drilldown. Supports nested lists, shared subforms, marker tracking (`insertMarker`, `deleteMarker`, `updateMarker`), column selection, soft-delete with undo, and full output modelling (`noOutput`, `outputObject`, `model`). Replaces the deprecated `table` field. (#379)
-   New `subform` property on `yaml` fields: when set, the field value is edited via a subform drilldown instead of a raw YAML editor, enabling structured single-object editing with full validation.
-   New `subform` form type: define reusable subforms (referenced by `list` and `yaml` fields) in the same forms file.
-   oauth2 swagger
-   build codes as part of the version

### Fixed

-   Dependency bug, field reset not populated to dependent placeholders
-   oauth2 init after create

### Deprecated

-   `table` field type is deprecated since 6.2.0. Existing `table` fields continue to work but show a deprecation warning. Migrate to the `list` field type combined with a `subform`.
-   `tableFields` / `Tablefield` property is deprecated since 6.2.0. Use the `subform` form type with regular `formfields` instead.
-   `disableRelaunch: true` (form property) is deprecated. Use `allowRelaunch: false` instead — positive naming, same effect.
-   `noOutput: true` (field property) is deprecated. Use `output: false` instead — positive naming, same effect.
-   `enableLogin` (role option) is deprecated. Use `allowLogin` instead — consistent with all other `allow*` role options.

## [6.1.5] - 2026-04-23

### Added

-   added role-option allowVerboseMode (#430)
-   added new role-options for jobscheduling and jobstoring (#431)

-   all api's have v2 implementations now
-   New YAML field type: A dedicated YAML editor field with syntax highlighting, validation, and file operations
-   Table field enhancements: Added file import/export capabilities

### Changed

-   role options are all defaulted now explicitly
-   api v1 and v2 split up for v1 deprecation
-   fixed a few security issues (block password retrieval over api)

### Deprecated

-   Data Sources and Data Schemas features - These features are currently only disabled in the GUI and will be completely removed in a future version. If you are actively using these features, please contact the maintainer as soon as possible.  The reason is the implementation of an ORM to switch to postgress in the future.
-   api v1 was not using the best rest implementation (let's say I was a rookie back then).

### Fixed

-   Error logging concatenation in token and job controllers (6 locations)
-   encoding in the expression functions
-   Cronschedules now handled with Croner, which should be better (#436)

### Changed

-   validIf triggers error
-   new docs using just the docs theme

-   Host and PID aware aborting, faster, cleaner and would allow multi container setup

## [6.1.3] - 2026-02-23

### Added

-   Sequential multistep

### Added

-   More Tile icon styling (size, color, overlayicon, overlaytext)

-   minValue, maxValue, minLength, maxLength, minSize and maxSize now support placeholders for dynamic validation.
-   Validation descriptions (regex, validIf, validIfNot, notIn, in) now support placeholders for dynamic error messages.
-   Field labels, help text, and placeholders now support placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., `$(fieldname)`).
-   Notification system enhancements: [issue 332](https://github.com/ansibleguy76/ansibleforms/issues/332).  New `onEvent` property for job lifecycle event notifications (any, launch, relaunch, delete, approve, reject)  Separate `jobevent.html` email template for event notifications (distinct from status notifications)
-   Configuration file migration from forms.yaml to config.yaml.  Introduction of new ENV VARS. `CONFIG_PATH`, `FORMS_FOLDER_PATH` 
-   Automated nightly backup system: New `NIGHTLY_BACKUP_RETENTION` environment variable
-   Multi-repository support for forms, add repo switches "use for config", 'use for varsfiles', 'use for forms', 'use for playbooks'.

### Changed

-   Refactored Job.launch, Job.continue, and Multistep.launch to use object parameters for better maintainability and flexibility
-   Notification system refactored.  Replaced individual event properties (onLaunch, onRelaunch, onDelete, onApprove, onReject) with unified `onEvent` array.  Cleaner separation: `onStatus` for job outcomes, `onEvent` for job lifecycle triggers
-   Configuration architecture modernized.  `forms.yaml` deprecated in favor of `config.yaml` (categories/roles/constants only).  Forms folder path now configurable via `FORMS_FOLDER_PATH` environment variable
-   removed label for html type.  If you want to have some sort of label, excplicitely set a label

### Deprecated

-   `forms.yaml` - use `config.yaml` for configuration (categories, roles, constants)
-   `FORMS_PATH` environment variable - still supported but will be removed in future versions
-   Storing forms in the base config file - forms should be in the forms/ folder

### Breaking

-   to allow user to relaunch, give them the role option `allowJobRelaunch`
-   Deprecated `on` notification property completely removed (use `onStatus` instead)
-   Notification event properties consolidated: use `onEvent: [launch, relaunch, delete, approve, reject]` instead of separate `onLaunch`, `onRelaunch`, etc. properties

### Fixed

-   approval message placeholder
-   small visual job issue
-   OIDC login (kudos to theymademedothat)
-   Password decrypt issue with mail settings
-   fixed credential cache issue

-   oauth2 table replaces individual azuread, oidc tables
-   integrated backup

### Changed

-   Backend rewritten to ESM (export default / import) -> no more "require" and no more "babel" and no more compiled code
-   Parsing of forms rewritten with individual form validation, should be more stable and faster
-   Backend bumped to Node.js 20
-   Most packages are updated to latest versions
-   Frontend rewritten to work with Vite (still vue2 for now) -> no more "webpack"
-   New sass-dart and bumped bulma framework to 1.0.4
-   Password decryption had a bug in v6beta

### Breaking Changes

-   Since "require" can not be used anymore, the backend code is now ESM only.
    This means that you can not use "require" anymore, but you can use "import" and "export default".  Than means that custom functions must be rewritten to use the new ESM syntax. (/functions/custom.js is an example where this could break)
-   Maybe not breaking, but the old theme is broken for bulma v1, so it might look a bit different here and there. (but note that v6 will have bootstrap)
-   Since many packages are updated, I might have missed some breaking changes like OIDC, packages have been bumped and I don't have an OIDC to test against... any help is appreciated.

## [5.0.10] - 2025-06-05

-   fn.fnRestAdvanced allows a new "raw" parameter to return the data + the response_headers
