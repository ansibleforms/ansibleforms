// The worker : AnsibleForms started with AF_ROLE=worker. It runs the background work and
// nothing else - the database bootstrap (schema, admin account, seed), the schedules, the
// nightly backup, the repository syncs and the cleanups - with no web interface or API.
//
// Several may run : one holds the worker lock and works, the others wait and take over when
// it stops (lib/workerLock.js). It needs what the app needs for that work : the database
// (DB_*), ENCRYPTION_SECRET, and the same persistent volume and ~/.ssh as the app nodes
// (forms, repositories, backups).
//
// It listens on PORT for the container healthcheck only :
//   GET <BASE_URL>/api/v2/version   the version, like an app node answers it
//   GET /health                     this node, and whether it holds the worker lock
