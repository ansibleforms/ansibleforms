//- MYSQL Module — shared connection pool
//
// All queries go through a single shared mysql2 connection pool (no more
// per-request createConnection/end cycles). Public API:
//   mysql.do(query, vars)  - run a query on a pool connection
//   mysql.doRetryingDeadlock(query, vars) - the same, run again when InnoDB picks it as a
//                            deadlock victim
//   mysql.end()            - close the pool (graceful shutdown)
//
// NOTE: multipleStatements is left enabled because schema bootstrap may run
// multi-statement DDL via mysql.do at startup. All runtime queries use
// parameterized `?` placeholders, so this does not introduce SQL injection
// risk in normal operation. Be careful when adding any code that concatenates
// user input into a query string.
