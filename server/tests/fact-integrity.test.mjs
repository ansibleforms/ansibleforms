//
// The rule this codebase already applies to health.model's authenticationFacts, applied
// to the two repository lookups that decide WHERE a save is written. Both wrapped their
// query in a catch that answered an empty value, and every caller read that as the truth:
//
//   getFormsFolders -> []  reads as "there are no forms repositories", so getSaveTargets
//                          computes repoMode=false, skips the "not cloned yet" guard,
//                          takes NO git write-lock, and writes every form into the local
//                          persistent/forms folder. The save reports success; once the
//                          database recovers the repository copies are served again and
//                          the user's work is gone.
//   getConfigPath   -> ""  reads as "use the local config file", same outcome for
//                          config.yaml.
