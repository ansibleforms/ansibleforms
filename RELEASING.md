# Releasing AnsibleForms

For maintainers. Contributors only need [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Everything below runs in GitHub Actions. Nothing is built or pushed from a laptop, and no
version number or changelog line is ever typed by hand.

There are two release lines: `main` (the newest major, 7) and `release/6.x` (patches of
the previous one). Everything below works the same on both; each
branch has its own release pull request, manifest and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## How a release happens

```
feature PR ──squash──▶ main ──▶ release-please updates the open "chore: release x.y.z" PR
                                              │
                           you merge it ──────┘
                                              ▼
                     tag x.y.z + GitHub release + image x.y.z and latest
```

1. Every pull request merged into `main` has a Conventional Commit title
   (`feat: ...`, `fix: ...`). See CONTRIBUTING.md for what each type does to the version.
2. After each merge, the **Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs
   release-please. It keeps **one** pull request open, titled `chore: release x.y.z`, that:
   - bumps `server/package.json` and `server/package-lock.json` to the next version
   - adds the section for that version at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`
   - updates `.release-please-manifest.json`
3. That open pull request is the "unreleased" list: its diff shows exactly what the next
   release contains.
4. **Merging it is the release.** The same workflow then creates the tag `x.y.z` (no `v`, like
   the tags before it), the GitHub release with the changelog section as notes, and calls
   **Publish**, which pushes the image to GHCR (Docker Hub is no longer published to).

### The image tags

The tags and what they point to are listed once, for users, under
[Image tags](https://ansibleforms.com/installation#image-tags) (`installation.md` in
[ansibleforms/website](https://github.com/ansibleforms/website)). Do not repeat or change them elsewhere.
publish.yml implements that list: `latest`, `<major>` and `<major>.<minor>` only move when
the release is the highest of its kind, so a patch on an older line never moves them
backwards. The release workflow also keeps GitHub's "Latest release" badge on the highest
version.

### Changing the changelog wording before a release

Edit `CHANGELOG.md` on the release pull request's branch (`release-please--branches--main`,
or `release-please--branches--release/6.x`) and push. Once the release exists, you can also edit the GitHub release notes directly.

That edit is lost when release-please rebuilds the branch after the next merge. A merged pull
request with the wrong title (a `feat:` that should be a `fix:`, which bumps the minor
version) is corrected at its source instead: add this to the merged pull request's
description, and the next merge to `main` makes release-please read it so.

```
BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
fix: the title it should have had
END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
```

### Forcing a specific version

Set `"release-as"` in `release-please-config.json`, in a pull request with a `feat:` or `fix:`
title, and merge it. release-please then proposes exactly that version. Remove the setting
again in the next pull request after the release, or every later release is proposed as that
same version.

```json
  "release-type": "simple",
  "release-as": "7.0.0",
```

A `Release-As:` line in the pull request description does **not** work reliably: GitHub
appends `Co-authored-by` lines after it when it squashes, so it is no longer read as a
footer. And a pull request with a hidden type (`ci:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) never opens a
release on its own, whatever it says.

## Release candidates

To test a pull request before it is merged: Actions → **Release candidate** → Run workflow →
enter the pull request number. That publishes:

- `ghcr.io/ansibleforms/ansibleforms:<next>-rc.<pr>.<run>`, for example `6.4.0-rc.512.7`
- `ghcr.io/ansibleforms/ansibleforms:latest-rc`

A comment on the pull request lists the tags. The UI and the Status page of that image
show the rc version.

`<next>` is the version the pull request would release. On the release pull request it is
exactly the upcoming version, so a candidate of that pull request tests the whole release.
Run the workflow again after new pushes to get a newer candidate.

A test server does not need an image copied to it: it can pull `latest-rc`.

Only pull requests from branches of this repository publish. A fork's code never runs with
the registry credentials.

## Publishing an existing release again

Actions → **Publish** → Run workflow → enter the tag (for example `6.3.1`). The workflow
refuses when `server/package.json` at that tag names another version.

## The RTE images

The RTE is published in three layers, each built FROM the one before, in the same publish run
and with the same tags as the app :

| Image | Dockerfile | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `ansibleforms-rte-base` | `docker/rte-base/Dockerfile` | node (`node:26-trixie-slim`, pinned by digest) and the server, git, ssh - no python, no ansible |
| `ansibleforms-rte-core` | `docker/rte-core/Dockerfile` | python and the packages in `docker/rte-core/requirements.txt` (ansible-core and a few libraries) |
| `ansibleforms-rte-full` | `docker/rte-full/Dockerfile` | the `ansible` package matching rte-core's ansible-core, the libraries and collections the 6.5 image had : `docker/rte-full/requirements.txt`, `collections.yml` and a few os tools |

- **Updates** : Dependabot moves the node pin in `docker/rte-base/Dockerfile` and the python pins
  in `docker/rte*/requirements.txt`. Each one is a pull request, so an image changes only with a
  commit. The collections of `-full` take their latest version at build time.
- **The chain** : `docker/rte-core` and `docker/rte-full` take `BASE_IMAGE`. `publish.yml` passes
  the digest it just pushed, and the Docker check (`docker.yml`) does the same through a
  registry that lives only for the job. Built by hand, they default to the published `:7`.
- The controller (`docker/controller/Dockerfile`) needs only node, git, ssh, the mariadb client and ytt, and builds from
  `node:26-trixie-slim` (pinned by digest, moved by Dependabot).

## A patch release of 6.x

Open the fix against `release/6.x` (see CONTRIBUTING.md: fix on main first, then
cherry-pick). release-please keeps a "chore: release 6.5.x" pull request open on that
branch; merging it releases and publishes, exactly like on main. Its config bumps the patch
only, so a stray `feat:` cannot make a 6.6.0.

## Setup this depends on

| What | Where | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub App `ansibleforms-release` (contents and pull requests: read and write) | installed on this repository, on `ansibleforms/website` (the release rebuilds the site), on `ansibleforms/helm-charts` (the release moves the chart's default image), on `ansibleforms/installer` (the release releases the installer) and on `ansibleforms/docker` (the release tags its setup) | release.yml |
| `RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` | repository variable: the App's client ID | release.yml |
| `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | repository secret | release.yml |
| ruleset on `main` and `release/*` | pull request required, squash only, required checks, no force push | everything |

The App token is needed because a pull request opened with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
starts no workflows, so the release pull request would never get its required checks.
